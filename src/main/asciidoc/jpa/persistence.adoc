We saw in link:mapping.html[JPA Mapping Guide] how to map classes for persistence with the JPA API.
In this guide we will describe the JPA API itself, showing how to persist, update and delete objects from persistence.

You should familiarise yourself with the http://www.datanucleus.org/javadocs/javax.persistence/2.1/[JPA 2.1 Javadocs].
