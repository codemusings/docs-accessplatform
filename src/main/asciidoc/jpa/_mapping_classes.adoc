We have the following types of classes in DataNucleus JPA.

* xref:class_mapping.html#entity[Entity] - persistable class with full control over its persistence.
* xref:class_mapping.html#mapped_superclass[MappedSuperclass] - persistable class that will not be persisted into its own table simply providing some fields to be persisted. 
Consequently an inheritance tree cannot just have a mapped superclass on its own.
* xref:class_mapping.html#embeddable[Embeddable] - persistable class that is only persistable embedded into an entity class.
* xref:class_mapping.html#persistence_aware[PersistenceAware] - a class that is not itself persisted, but that needs to access internals of persistable classes. *This is a DataNucleus extension, nit part of the JPA standard*.



[[entity]]
== Class: Entity

Let's take a sample class (_Hotel_) as an example. We can define a class as persistable using either annotations in the class, or XML metadata.
To achieve the above aim with XML metadata, we do this

[source,xml]
-----
<entity class="org.datanucleus.test.Hotel">
    ...
</entity>
-----

Alternatively, using link:annotations.html[JPA Annotations], like this
[source,java]
-----
@Entity
public class Hotel
{
    ...
}
-----



[[mapped_superclass]]
== Class: MappedSuperclass

Say we have an abstract base class _Building_ with concrete subclass _Hotel_ (as above). We want to persist some fields of _Building_, but it is abstract so
will not have any objects of that type. So we make the class a _MappedSuperclass_, like this

[source,xml]
-----
<mapped-superclass class="org.datanucleus.test.Building">
    ...
</mapped-superclass>
-----

Alternatively, using link:annotations.html[JPA Annotations], like this
[source,java]
-----
@MappedSuperclass
public abstract class Building
{
    ...
}
-----

This is of particular relevance when considering link:orm/inheritance.html#mappedsuperclass[inheritance].



[[embeddable]]
== Class: Embeddable

Here we have a class _ConstructionDetails_ that we never need to persist individually, and it will only ever be persisted as part of an owner object (in this case _Building_).
Since information from objects of this class will be persisted, we need to mark the class as _Embeddable_, like this

[source,xml]
-----
<embeddable class="org.datanucleus.test.ConstructionDetails">
    ...
</mapped-superclass>
-----

Alternatively, using link:annotations.html[JPA Annotations], like this
[source,java]
-----
@Embeddable
public class ConstructionDetails
{
    ...
}
-----

and hereafter we can persist fields of type _ConstructionDetails_, as per link:orm/embedded.html[the Embedded Object guide].



[[persistence_aware]]
== Class: Persistence Aware

image:../images/nucleus_extension.png[]

With JPA you cannot access _public_ fields of classes. DataNucleus allows an extension to permit this, but such classes need special enhancement. To allow this you need to
annotate the class that will access these public fields (assuming it isn't an Entity) with the DataNucleus extension annotation @PersistenceAware, as follows

[source,java]
-----
@PersistenceAware
public class MyClassThatAccessesPublicFields
{
    ...
}
-----

See also :-

* link:annotations.html#PersistenceAware[Annotations reference for @PersistenceAware]


[[read_only]]
== Class: Read-Only

image:../images/nucleus_extension.png[]

You can, if you wish, make a class _read-only_. This is a DataNucleus extension and you set it as follows

[source,java]
-----
@Entity
@Extension(key="read-only", value="true")
public class MyClass
{
    ...
}
-----
