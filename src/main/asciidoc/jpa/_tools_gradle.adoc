http://gradle.org[Gradle] is a build tool that is used in some organisations. 
DataNucleus does not currently have an official plugin for using Gradle to build DataNucleus projects.
If you develop such a tool, to perform enhancement, and SchemaTool operations then please contact us so that it can be distributed as part of the DataNucleus project.

In the meantime you could look at https://divinespear.github.io/jpa-schema-gradle-plugin/[this plugin project] which claims to work with DataNucleus v4.2.x for JPA.
