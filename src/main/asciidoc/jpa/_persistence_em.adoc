[[em]]
= EntityManager
:_basedir: ../
:_imagesdir: images/

Now that we have our link:#emf[EntityManagerFactory], providing the connection for our _persistence-unit_ to our datastore, we need
to obtain an _EntityManager_ to manage the persistence of objects. Here we describe the majority of operations that you will are likely
to need to know about.

NOTE: An _EntityManagerFactory_ is designed to be thread-safe. An _EntityManager_ is not.* 
If you set the persistence property *datanucleus.Multithreaded* this acts as a hint to the EMF to provide _EntityManager_s that are usable with multiple threads. 
While DataNucleus makes efforts to make this _EntityManager_ usable with multiple threads, it is not guaranteed to work multi-threaded in all situations, 
particularly around second class collection/map fields.

To take an example, suppose we have the following (abbreviated) entities

[source,java]
-----
@Entity
public class Person
{
    @Id
    long id;
    
    String firstName;
    String lastName;
}

@Entity
public class Account
{
    @Id
    long id;

    @OneToOne
    Person person;
}
-----

== Opening/Closing an EntityManager

You obtain an _EntityManager_
http://www.datanucleus.org/javadocs/javax.persistence/2.1/javax/persistence/EntityManager.html[image:../images/javadoc.png[]]
from the _EntityManagerFactory_ as follows

[source,java]
-----
EntityManager em = emf.createEntityManager();
-----

In the case of using container-managed JavaEE, you would instead obtain the _EntityManager_ by injection

[source,java]
-----
@PersistenceContext(unitName="myPU")
EntityManager em;
-----

You then perform all operations that you need using this _EntityManager_ and finally you must *close* it. Forgetting to close it will lead to memory/resource leaks.

[source,java]
-----
em.close();
-----

In general you will be performing all operations on a _EntityManager_ within a link:#transaction[transaction], whether your transactions are controlled by your JavaEE container, 
by a framework such as Spring, or by locally defined transactions. In the examples below we will omit the transaction demarcation for clarity.


== Persisting an Object

The main thing that you will want to do with the data layer of a JPA-enabled application is persist your objects into the datastore. 
As we mentioned earlier, a _EntityManagerFactory_ represents the datastore where the objects will be persisted. 
So you create a normal Java object in your application, and you then persist this as follows

[source,java]
-----
Person lincoln = new Person(1, "Abraham", "Lincoln");
em.persist(lincoln);
-----

This will result in the object being persisted into the datastore, though clearly it will not be persistent until you commit the transaction. 
The link:#lifecycle[Lifecycle State] of the object changes from _Transient_ to _Persistent_ (after persist()), to _Persistent_/_Detached_ (at commit).


== Persisting multiple Objects in one call

image:../images/nucleus_extension.png[]

When you want to persist multiple objects with standard JPA you have to call _persist_ multiple times. 
Fortunately DataNucleus extends this to take in a Collection or an array of entities, so you can do

[source,java]
-----
Collection<Person> coll = new HashSet<>();
coll.add(lincoln);
coll.add(mandela);

em.persist(coll);
-----

As above, the objects are persisted to the datastore. The LifecycleState of the objects change from _Transient_ to _PersistentClean_ (after persist()), to _Hollow_ (at commit).


== Finding an object by its identity

Once you have persisted an object, it has an "identity". This is a unique way of identifying it.
When you specify the persistence for the entity you specified an id field (or fields, together with an _IdClass_) so you can create the identity from that.
So what ? Well the identity can be used to retrieve the object again at some other part in your application. 
So you pass the identity into your application, and the user clicks on some button on a web page and that button corresponds to a particular object identity. 
You can then go back to your data layer and retrieve the object as follows

[source,java]
-----
Person p = em.find(Person.class, 1);
-----

which will try to retrieve the _Person_ object with identity of 1. If there is no _Person_ object with that identity then it returns _null_.


NOTE: the first argument could be a base class and the real object could be an instance of a subclass of that.

NOTE: the second argument is either the value of the single primary-key field (when it has only one `@Id` field), 
or is the value of the _object-id-class_ (when it has multiple `@Id` fields).


== Deleting an Object

When you need to delete an object that you had previous persisted, deleting it is simple.
Firstly you need to get the object itself, and then delete it as follows

[source,java]
-----
Person lincoln = em.find(Person.class, 1);  // Retrieves the object to delete
em.remove(lincoln);
-----


== Deleting multiple Objects

image:../images/nucleus_extension.png[]

When you want to delete multiple objects with standard JPA you have to call _remove_ multiple times. 
Fortunately DataNucleus extends this to take in a Collection or an array of entities, so you can do

[source,java]
-----
Collection<Person> people = new HashSet<>();
people.add(lincoln);
people.add(mandela);
em.remove(people);
-----


== Modifying a persisted Object

To modify a previously persisted object you take the object and update it in your code. When you are ready to persist the changes you do the following

[source,java]
-----
Object updatedObj = em.merge(obj);
-----

This does, however, depend on the link:#lifecycle[lifecycle state] of the object. In the example above we assume the object is _detached_, so not managed by 
a particular _EntityManager_. If however the object was already managed, then 

[source,java]
-----
Person lincoln = em.find(Person.class, 1); // "lincoln" is now managed by "em", and in "persistent" state.

lincoln.setAddress("The White House");
-----

when the _setAddress_ has been called, this is intercepted by DataNucleus, and the changes will be stored for persisting. There is no need
to call any _EntityManager_ method to push the changes. This is part of the mechanism known as _transparent persistence_.


== Modifying multiple persisted Objects

image:../images/nucleus_extension.png[]

When you want to attach multiple modified objects with standard JPA you have to call _merge_ multiple times. 
Fortunately DataNucleus extends this to take in a Collection or an array of entities, so you can do

[source,java]
-----
Object updatedObj = em.merge(coll);
-----


== Refreshing a persisted Object

An application that has sole access to the datastore, in general, does not need to check for updated values from the datastore.
In more complicated situations the datastore may be updated by another application for example, so it may be necessary at times
to check for more up-to-date values for the fields of an entity. You do that like this

[source,java]
-----
em.refresh(lincoln);
-----

This will do the following

* Refresh all fields that are to be eagerly fetched from the datastore
* Unload all loaded fields that are to be lazily fetched.

If the object had any changes they will be thrown away by this step, and replaced by the latest datastore values.


== Getting EntityManager for an object

image:../images/nucleus_extension.png[]

JPA doesn't provide a method for getting the EntityManager of an object as such. Fortunately DataNucleus provides the following

[source,java]
-----
import org.datanucleus.api.jpa.NucleusJPAHelper;

...

EntityManager em = NucleusJPAHelper.getEntityManager(obj);
-----

If you have an _EntityManager_ object and want to check if it is managing a particular object you can call

[source,java]
-----
boolean managedByThisEM = em.contains(lincoln);
-----


[[cascading]]
== Cascading Operations

When you have relationships between entities, and you persist one entity, by default the related entity will _not_ be persisted.
For each of the relation annotations `@OneToOne`, `@OneToMany`, `@ManyToOne` and `@ManyToMany` there is an attribute _cascade_ which defaults to null
but you can control what operations cascade (persist, remove, merge, detach, refresh).

Let's use our example above, and create new _Person_ and _Account_ objects.

[source,java]
-----
Person lincoln = new Person(1, "Abraham", "Lincoln");
Account acct1 = new Account(1, lincoln); // Second argument sets the relation between the objects
-----

now to persist them both we have two options. Firstly with the default cascade setting

[source,java]
-----
em.persist(lincoln);
em.persist(acct1);
-----

The second option is to set the metadata on _Account_ as

[source,java]
-----
@Entity
public class Account
{
    @Id
    long id;

    @OneToOne(cascade={CascadeType.PERSIST, CascadeType.MERGE})
    Person person;
}
-----

now we can simply do this (since the _Account_ has a reference to _Person_);

[source,java]
-----
em.persist(acct1);
-----


[[orphanremoval]]
== Orphans

When an element is removed from a collection, or when a 1-1 relation is nulled, sometimes it is desirable to delete the other object.
JPA defines a facility of removing "orphans" by specifying metadata for a 1-1 or 1-N relation. Let's take our example. 
In the above relation between _Account_ and _Person_ if we set the "person" field to null, this should mean that the _Person_ record is deleted.
So we could change the metadata to

[source,java]
-----
@Entity
public class Account
{
    @Id
    long id;

    @OneToOne(cascade={CascadeType.PERSIST, CascadeType.MERGE}, `orphanRemoval`=true)
    Person person;
}
-----

So from now on, if we delete the _Account_ we delete the _Person_, and if we set the "person" field of _Account_ to null then we also delete the _Person_.



[[level1_cache]]
== Level 1 Cache

Each EntityManager maintains a cache of the objects that it has encountered (or have been "enlisted") during its lifetime. 
This is termed the *Level 1 Cache*. It is enabled by default and you should only ever disable it if you really know what you are doing.
There are inbuilt types for the Level 1 (L1) Cache available for selection.
DataNucleus supports the following types of L1 Cache :-

* _weak_ - uses a weak reference backing map. If JVM garbage collection clears the reference, then the object is removed from the cache.
* _soft_ - uses a soft reference backing map. If the map entry value object is not being actively used, then garbage collection _may_ garbage collect the reference, 
in which case the object is removed from the cache.
* _strong_ - uses a normal HashMap backing. With this option all references are strong meaning that objects stay in the cache until they are explicitly removed by calling 
remove() on the cache.

You can specify the type of L1 Cache by providing the persistence property *datanucleus.cache.level1.type*. You set this to the value of the type required. 
If you want to remove all objects from the L1 cache programmatically you should use _em.clear()_ but bear in mind the other things that this will impact on.

Objects are placed in the L1 Cache (and updated there) during the course of the transaction.
This provides rapid access to the objects in use in the users application and is used to guarantee that there is only one object with a particular identity at any one time
for that EntityManager. When the EntityManager is closed the cache is cleared.

link:../extensions/extensions.html#cache_level1[image:../images/nucleus_plugin.png[]]
The L1 cache is a DataNucleus plugin point allowing you to provide your own cache where you require it.
