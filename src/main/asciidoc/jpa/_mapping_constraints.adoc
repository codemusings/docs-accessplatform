A datastore often provides ways of constraining the storage of data to maintain relationships and improve performance. These are known as _constraints_ and they come in various forms. 
These are :-

* link:#index[Indexes] - these are used to mark fields that are referenced often as indexes so that when they are used the performance is optimised.
* link:#unique[Unique constraints] - these are placed on fields that should have a unique value. That is, only one object will have a particular value.
* link:#fk[Foreign-Keys] - these are used to interrelate objects, and allow the datastore to keep the integrity of the data in the datastore.
* link:#pk[Primary-Keys] - allow the PK to be set, and also to have a name.

[[index]]
== Indexes

NOTE: Applicable to RDBMS, NeoDatis, MongoDB

Many datastores provide the ability to have indexes defined to give performance benefits.
With RDBMS the indexes are specified on the table and the indexes to the rows are stored 
separately. In the same way an ODBMS typically allows indexes to be specified on the fields 
of the class, and these are managed by the datastore. JPA 2.1 allows you to define the indexes
on a table-by-table basis by metadata as in the following example (note that you cannot specify
indexes on a field basis like in JDO)

[source,java]
-----
import javax.persistence.Index;

@Entity
@Table(indexes={@Index(name="SOME_VAL_IDX", columnList="SOME_VALUE")})
public class MyClass
{
    @Column(name="SOME_VALUE")
    long someValue;

    ...
}

The JPA @Index annotation is only applicable at a class level. DataNucleus provides its own @Index annotation that you
can specify on a field/method to signify that the column(s) for this field/method will be indexed. Like this

[source,java]
-----
@Entity
public class MyClass
{
    @org.datanucleus.api.jpa.annotations.Index(name="VAL_IDX")
    long someValue;

    ...
}
-----


[[unique]]
== Unique constraints

NOTE: Applicable to RDBMS, NeoDatis, MongoDB

Some datastores provide the ability to have unique constraints defined on tables to give extra control over data integrity. 
JPA provides a mechanism for defining such unique constraints. Let's take an example class, and show how to specify this

[source,java]
-----
public class Person
{
    String forename;
    String surname;
    String nickname;
    ...
}
-----

and here we want to impose uniqueness on the "nickname" field, so there is only one Person known as "DataNucleus Guru" for example !

[source,xml]
-----
<entity class="Person">
    <table name="PEOPLE"/>
    <attributes>
        ...
        <basic name="nickname">
            <column name="SURNAME" unique="true"/>
        </basic>
        ...
    </attributes>
</entity>
-----

The second use of unique constraints is where we want to impose uniqueness across composite columns.
So we reuse the class above, and this time we want to impose a constraint that there is only one Person with a particular "forename+surname".

[source,xml]
-----
<entity class="Person">
    <table name="PEOPLE">
        <unique-constraint>
            <column-name>FORENAME</column-name>
            <column-name>SURNAME</column-name>
        </unique-constraint>
    </table>
    <attributes>
        ...
        <basic name="forename">
            <column name="FORENAME"/>
        </basic>
        <basic name="surname">
            <column name="SURNAME"/>
        </basic>
        ...
    </attributes>
</entity>
-----

In the same way we can also impose unique constraints on <join-table> and <secondary-table>

[[fk]]
== Foreign Keys

NOTE: Applicable to RDBMS

When objects have relationships with one object containing, for example, a Collection of another object, it is common to store a foreign key 
in the datastore representation to link the two associated tables. Moreover, it is common to define behaviour about what happens to the dependent 
object when the owning object is deleted. Should the deletion of the owner cause the deletion of the dependent object maybe ? 
JPA 2.1 adds support for defining the foreign key for relation fields as per the following example

[source,java]
-----
public class MyClass
{
    ...

    @OneToOne
    @JoinColumn(name="OTHER_ID", foreignKey=@ForeignKey(name="OTHER_FK", 
        foreignKeyDefinition="FOREIGN KEY (OTHER_ID) REFERENCES MY_OTHER_TBL (MY_OTHER_ID) ]"))
    MyOtherClass other;

}
-----

Note that when you don't specify any foreign key the JPA provider is free to add the foreign keys that it considers are necessary.                


[[pk]]
== Primary Keys

NOTE: Applicable to RDBMS

In RDBMS datastores, it is accepted as good practice to have a primary key on all tables. You specify in other parts of the MetaData 
which fields are part of the primary key (if using application identity). Unfortunately JPA doesnt allow specification of the name of the primary key constraint, nor of whether
join tables are given a primary key constraint at all.
