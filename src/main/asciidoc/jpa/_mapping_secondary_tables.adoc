NOTE: Applicable to RDBMS

The standard JPA persistence strategy is to persist an object of a class into its own table. In some 
situations you may wish to map the class to a primary table as well as one or more secondary tables. 
For example when you have a Java class that could have been split up into 2 separate classes yet, for 
whatever reason, has been written as a single class, however you have a legacy datastore and you need to 
map objects of this class into 2 tables. JPA allows persistence of fields of a class into _secondary_
tables.

The process for managing this situation is best demonstrated with an example. Let's suppose we have a class
that represents a *Printer*. The *Printer* class contains within it various attributes of the
toner cartridge. So we have

[source,java]
-----
package com.mydomain.samples.secondarytable;

public class Printer
{
    long id;
    String make;
    String model;

    String tonerModel;
    int tonerLifetime;

    /**
     * Constructor.
     * @param make Make of printer (e.g Hewlett-Packard)
     * @param model Model of Printer (e.g LaserJet 1200L)
     * @param tonerModel Model of toner cartridge
     * @param tonerLifetime lifetime of toner (number of prints)
     */
    public Printer(String make, String model, String tonerModel, int tonerLifetime)
    {
        this.make = make;
        this.model = model;
        this.tonerModel = tonerModel;
        this.tonerLifetime = tonerLifetime;
    }

}
-----

Now we have a database schema that has 2 tables (PRINTER and PRINTER_TONER) in which to store objects of this class.
So we need to tell DataNucleus to perform this mapping. So we define the MetaData for the *Printer* class like this

[source,xml]
-----
<entity class="Printer">
    <table name="PRINTER"/>
    <secondary-table name="PRINTER_TONER">
        <primary-key-join-column name="PRINTER_REFID"/>
    </secondary-table>

    <attributes>
        <id name="id">
            <column name="PRINTER_ID"/>
        </id>
        <basic name="make">
            <column name="MAKE" length="40"/>
        </basic>
        <basic name="model">
            <column name="MODEL" length="100"/>
        </basic>
        <basic name="tonerModel">
            <column name="MODEL" table="PRINTER_TONER"/>
        </basic>
        <basic name="tonerLifetime">
            <column name="LIFETIME" table="PRINTER_TONER"/>
        </basic>
    </attributes>
</entity>
-----

Here we have defined that objects of the *Printer* class will be stored in the primary table PRINTER. 
In addition we have defined that some fields are stored in the table PRINTER_TONER.

<li>We declare the "secondary-table"(s) that we will be using at the start of the definition.
<li>We define _tonerModel_ and _tonerLifetime_ to use columns in the table PRINTER_TONER. This uses the "table" attribute of <column>
<li>Whilst defining the secondary table(s) we will be using, we also define the join column to be called "PRINTER_REFID".

This results in the following database tables :-

image:../images/secondarytables_db.png[]

So we now have our primary and secondary database tables. The primary key of the PRINTER_TONER table serves as a foreign key to the primary class. 
Whenever we persist a *Printer* object a row will be inserted into *both* of these tables.
