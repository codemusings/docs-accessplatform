DataNucleus is developed as a plugin-driven framework and one of the components that is pluggable is the Level 1 caching of objects 
(between PM/EMs for the same PMF/EMF). DataNucleus comes with builtin support for three Level 1 caches, but is a plugin point so that you can 
easily add your own variant and have it usable within your DataNucleus usage.

DataNucleus is able to support third party Level 1 Cache products. There are DataNucleus-provided plugins for
weak, soft referenced caches etc. You can extend DataNucleus's capabilities using the plugin extension *org.datanucleus.cache_level1*.

The following sections describe how to create your own Level 1 cache plugin for DataNucleus.

== Interface

If you have your own Level1 cache you can easily use it with DataNucleus. DataNucleus defines a Level1Cache interface and you need to implement this.
http://www.datanucleus.org/javadocs/core/latest/org/datanucleus/cache/Level1Cache.html[image:../images/javadoc.png[Javadoc]].

[source,java]
-----
package org.datanucleus.cache;

public interface Level1Cache extends Map
{
}
-----

So you need to create a class, __MyLevel1Cache__ for example, that implements this interface (i.e that implements _java.util.Map_).


== Plugin Specification

Once you have this implementation you then need to make the class available as a DataNucleus plugin. You do this by putting a file 
`plugin.xml` in your JAR at the root of the CLASSPATH, like this

[source,xml]
-----
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<plugin id="mydomain.mycache" name="DataNucleus plug-ins" provider-name="My Company">
    <extension point="org.datanucleus.cache_level1">
        <cache name="MyCache" class-name="mydomain.MyLevel1Cache"/>
    </extension>
</plugin>
-----

Note that you also require a `MANIFEST.MF` file as xref:extensions.adoc#MANIFEST[described above].

== Plugin Usage

The only thing remaining is to use your L1 Cache plugin. To do this you specify the 
persistence property _datanucleus.cache.level1.type_ as __MyCache__ (the "name" in `plugin.xml`).
