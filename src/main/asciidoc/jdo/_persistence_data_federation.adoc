By default JDO provides a link:persistence.html#pmf[PersistenceManagerFactory] (PMF) to represent a single datastore.
Some applications need access to multiple datastores and the standard way of handling this is to have one PMF for each datastore.

As an alternative DataNucleus allows having a PMF represent multiple datastores. 

WARNING: This is functionality that is work-in-progress and only tested for basic persist/retrieve operations using different schemas of the same datastore.
It may work for some things but you need to treat it with caution.

NOTE: Obviously if you have relations between one object in one datastore and another object in another datastore you cannot have _foreign-keys_ (or equivalent).


== Defining Primary and Secondary Datastores

You could specify the datastores to be used for the PMF like this. Here we have `datanucleus.properties` defining the *primary datastore*

-----
javax.jdo.option.ConnectionDriverName=com.mysql.jdbc.Driver
javax.jdo.option.ConnectionURL=jdbc:mysql://127.0.0.1/nucleus?useServerPrepStmts=false
javax.jdo.option.ConnectionUserName=mysql
javax.jdo.option.ConnectionPassword=

datanucleus.datastore.store2=datanucleus2.properties
-----

You note that this refers to a *store2*, which is defined by `datanucleus2.properties`.
So the *secondary datastore* is then defined by another file.
-----
javax.jdo.option.ConnectionURL=mongodb:/nucleus
-----


== Defining which class is persisted to which datastore

Now we need to notate which class is persisted to the *primary* datastore and which is persisted to *secondary* datastores. 
We do it like this, for the classes persisted to the secondary datastore.

[source,java]
-----
@PersistenceCapable
@Extension(vendorName="datanucleus", key="datastore", value="store2")
public class MyOtherClass
{
    ...
}
-----

So for any persistence of objects of type _MyOtherClass_, they will be persisted into the MongoDB secondary datastore.
