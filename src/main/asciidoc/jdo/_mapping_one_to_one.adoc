[[one_one_relations]]
= 1-1 Relations
:_basedir: ../

You have a 1-to-1 relationship when an object of a class has an associated object of another class (only one associated object). 
It could also be between an object of a class and another object of the same class (obviously). 
You can create the relationship in 2 ways depending on whether the 2 classes know about each other (bidirectional), 
or whether only one of the classes knows about the other class (unidirectional). 
These are described below.

NOTE: For RDBMS a 1-1 relation is stored as a foreign-key column(s). For non-RDBMS it is stored as a String "column" storing the 'id' 
(possibly with the class-name included in the string) of the related object.


[[one_one_uni]]
== Unidirectional

For this case you could have 2 classes, *User* and *Account*, as below.

[source,java]
-----
public class Account
{
    User user;
}

public class User
{
    ...
}
-----

so the *Account* class knows about the *User* class, but not vice-versa. If you define the annotations for these classes as follows

[source,java]
-----
public class Account
{
    ...

    @Column(name="USER_ID")
    User user;
}

public class User
{
    ...
}
-----

or using XML metadata

[source,xml]
-----
<package name="mydomain">
    <class name="User" table="USER">
        ...
    </class>

    <class name="Account" table="ACCOUNT">
        ...
        <field name="user">
            <column name="USER_ID"/>
        </field>
    </class>
</package>
-----

This contrasts with JPA mapping where you have to _explicitly_ specify that it is a one-to-one relation!

This will create 2 tables in the database, one for *User* (with name _USER_), and one for *Account* (with name _ACCOUNT_ and a column _USER_ID_), as shown below.

Things to note :-

NOTE: *Account* has the object reference (and so owns the relation) to *User* and so its table holds the foreign-key

NOTE: If you call _PM.deletePersistent()_ on the end of a 1-1 unidirectional relation without the relation and that object is related to another object, an exception will typically be thrown 
(assuming the datastore supports foreign keys). To delete this record you should remove the other objects association first.

TIP: If you invoke an operation that will retrieve the one-to-one field, and you only want it to get the foreign key value (and not join to the related table) 
you can add the metadata extension _fetch-fk-only_ (set to "true") to the field/property.



[[one_one_bi]]
== Bidirectional

For this case you could have 2 classes, *User* and *Account* again, but this time as below. Here the *Account* class knows about the *User* class, and also vice-versa.

[source,java]
-----
public class Account
{
    User user;

    ...
}

public class User
{
    Account account;

    ...
}
-----


We create the 1-1 relationship with a single foreign-key. To do this you define the annotations as

[source,java]
-----
public class Account
{
    ...

    @Column(name="USER_ID")
    User user;
}

public class User
{
    ...

    @Persistent(mappedBy="user")
    Account account;
}
-----

or using XML metadata

[source,xml]
-----
<package name="mydomain">
    <class name="User" table="USER">
        ...
        <field name="account" mapped-by="user"/>
    </class>

    <class name="Account" table="ACCOUNT">
        ...
        <field name="user">
            <column name="USER_ID"/>
        </field>
    </class>
</package>
-----

The difference is that we added _mapped-by_ to the field of *User*. This represents the bidirectionality.

This will create 2 tables in the database, one for *User* (with name _USER_), and one for *Account* (with name _ACCOUNT_). 
With RDBMS the _ACCOUNT_ table will have a column _USER_ID_ (since RDBMS will place the FK on the side without the "mapped-by"). Like this

image:../images/relationship_1_1_bi_db_singlefk.png[]

With non-RDBMS datastores both tables will have a column containing the "id" of the related object, that is _USER_ will have an ACCOUNT column, and _ACCOUNT_ will have a USER_ID column.

NOTE: When forming the relation please make sure that *you set the relation at BOTH sides* since DataNucleus would have no way of knowing which end is correct if you only set one end.

TIP: If you invoke an operation that will retrieve the one-to-one field (of the non-owner side), and you only want it to get the foreign key value (and not join to the related table) you 
can add the metadata extension _fetch-fk-only_ (set to "true") to the field/property.
