Persistence operations performed by the _PersistenceManager_ are typically managed in a _transaction_, allowing operations to be grouped together.
A Transaction forms a unit of work. The Transaction manages what happens within that unit of work, and when an error occurs the Transaction can roll back any changes performed. 
Transactions can be managed by the users application, or can be managed by a framework (such as Spring), or can be managed by a JavaEE container. 
These are described below.

* link:#transaction_local[Local transactions] : managed using the JDO Transaction API
* link:#transaction_jta[JTA transactions] : managed using the JTA UserTransaction API, or using the JDO Transaction API
* link:#transaction_container[Container-managed transactions] : managed by a JavaEE environment
* link:#transaction_spring[Spring-managed transactions] : managed by SpringFramework
* link:#transaction_nontransactional[No transactions] : "auto-commit" mode
* link:#transaction_flushing[Flushing a Transaction]
* link:#transaction_isolation[Controlling transaction isolation level]
* link:#transaction_synchronisation[Synchronising with transaction commit]

[[transaction_local]]
== Locally-Managed Transactions

When using a JDO implementation such as DataNucleus in a JavaSE environment, the transactions are by default *Locally Managed Transactions*. 
The users code will manage the transactions by starting, committing or rolling back the transaction itself. 
With these transactions with JDO http://www.datanucleus.org/javadocs/javax.jdo/3.2/javax/jdo/Transaction.html[image:../images/javadoc.png[]]
you would do something like

[source,java]
-----
PersistenceManager pm = pmf.getPersistenceManager();
Transaction tx = pm.currentTransaction();
try
{
    tx.begin();
    
    {users code to persist objects}
    
    tx.commit();
}
finally
{
    if (tx.isActive())
    {
        tx.rollback();
    }
    pm.close();
}
-----

The basic idea with *Locally-Managed transactions* is that you are managing the transaction start and end.


[[transaction_jta]]
== JTA Transactions

When using a JDO implementation such as DataNucleus in a JavaSE environment, you can also make use of *JTA Transactions*. 
You need to define the persistence property *javax.jdo.option.TransactionType* setting it to _JTA_. 
Then you make use of JTA (or JDO) to demarcate the transactions. So you could do something like

[source,java]
-----
UserTransaction ut = (UserTransaction)new InitialContext().lookup("java:comp/UserTransaction");
PersistenceManager pm = pmf.getPersistenceManager();
try
{
    ut.begin();
    
    {users code to persist objects}
    
    ut.commit();
}
finally
{
    pm.close();
}
-----

So here we used the JTA API to begin/commit the controlling (_javax.transaction.UserTransaction_).


An alternative is where you don't have a UserTransaction started and just use the JDO API, which will start the UserTransaction for you.

[source,java]
-----
UserTransaction ut = (UserTransaction)new InitialContext().lookup("java:comp/UserTransaction");
PersistenceManager pm = pmf.getPersistenceManager();
Transaction tx = pm.currentTransaction();
try
{
    tx.begin(); // Starts the UserTransaction
    
    {users code to persist objects}
    
    tx.commit(); // Commits the UserTransaction
}
finally
{
    pm.close();
}
-----

IMPORTANT: You need to set both transactional and nontransactional datasources, and *the nontransactional cannot be JTA. The nontransactional is used for schema and sequence operations.

=== JTA TransactionManager

Note that the JavaEE spec does not define a standard way of finding the JTA TransactionManager, and so all JavaEE containers have their own ways of handling this.
DataNucleus provides a way of scanning the various methods to find that appropriate for the JavaEE container in use, but you can explicitly
set the method of finding the _TransactionManager_, by use of the persistence properties *datanucleus.transaction.jta.transactionManagerLocator* and, 
if using this property set to _custom_jndi_ then also *datanucleus.transaction.jta.transactionManagerJNDI* set to the JNDI location that stores the _TransactionManager_ instance.


[[transaction_container]]
== Container-Managed Transactions

When using a JavaEE container you are giving over control of the transactions to the container. 
Here you have *Container-Managed Transactions*. In terms of your code, you would do like 
the above examples *except* that you would OMIT the _tx.begin(), tx.commit(), 
tx.rollback()_ since the JavaEE container will be doing this for you.


[[transaction_spring]]
== Spring-Managed Transactions

When you use a framework like http://www.springframework.org[Spring] 
you would not need to specify the _tx.begin(), tx.commit(), tx.rollback()_ since that would be done for you.


[[transaction_nontransactional]]
== No Transactions

DataNucleus allows the ability to operate without transactions. 
With DataNucleus JDO this is enabled by default (see the 2 properties *datanucleus.transaction.nontx.read*, *datanucleus.transaction.nontx.write* set to _true_, the default). 
This means that you can read objects and make updates outside of transactions. This is effectively "auto-commit" mode.

[source,java]
-----
PersistenceManager pm = pmf.getPersistenceManager();
    
{users code to persist objects}

pm.close();
-----

When using non-transactional operations, you need to pay attention to the persistence property *datanucleus.transaction.nontx.atomic*. 
If this is true then any persist/delete/update will be committed to the datastore immediately. 
If this is false then any persist/delete/update will be queued up until the next transaction (or _pm.close()_) and committed with that.



[[transaction_flushing]]
== Flushing

During a transaction, depending on the configuration, operations don't necessarily go to the datastore immediately, often waiting until _commit_. 
In some situations you need persists/updates/deletes to be in the datastore so that subsequent operations can be performed that rely on those being handled first. 
In this case you can *flush* all outstanding changes to the datastore using

[source,java]
-----
pm.flush();
-----


image:../images/nucleus_extension.png[]

A convenient vendor extension is to find which objects are waiting to be flushed at any time, like this

[source,java]
-----
List<ObjectProvider> objs = ((JDOPersistenceManager)pm).getExecutionContext().getObjectsToBeFlushed();
-----


[[transaction_isolation]]
== Transaction Isolation

JDO provides a mechanism for specification of the transaction isolation level. 
This can be specified globally via the persistence property *datanucleus.transaction.isolation* (javax.jdo.option.TransactionIsolationLevel).
It accepts the following values

* *read-uncommitted* : dirty reads, non-repeatable reads and phantom reads can occur
* *read-committed* : dirty reads are prevented; non-repeatable reads and phantom reads can occur
* *repeatable-read* : dirty reads and non-repeatable reads are prevented; phantom reads can occur
* *serializable* : dirty reads, non-repeatable reads and phantom reads are prevented

The default (in DataNucleus) is *read-committed*. An attempt to set the isolation level to an unsupported value (for the datastore) will throw a JDOUserException.
As an alternative you can also specify it on a per-transaction basis as follows (using the names above).

[source,java]
-----
Transaction tx = pm.currentTransaction();
...
tx.setIsolationLevel("read-committed");
-----


[[transaction_synchronisation]]
== JDO Transaction Synchronisation

There are situations where you may want to get notified that a transaction is in course of being committed or rolling back. 
To make that happen, you would do something like

[source,java]
-----
PersistenceManager pm = pmf.getPersistenceManager();
Transaction tx = pm.currentTransaction();
try
{
    tx.begin();

    tx.setSynchronization(new javax.transaction.Synchronization()
    {
        public void beforeCompletion()
        {
             // before commit or rollback
        }

        public void afterCompletion(int status)
        {
            if (status == javax.transaction.Status.STATUS_ROLLEDBACK)
            {
                // rollback
            }
            else if (status == javax.transaction.Status.STATUS_COMMITTED)
            {
                // commit
            }
        }
    });
    
    tx.commit();
}
finally
{
    if (tx.isActive())
    {
        tx.rollback();
    }
}
pm.close();
-----


[[transaction_readonly]]
== Read-Only Transactions

Obviously transactions are intended for committing changes. If you come across a situation where you don't want to commit anything under any 
circumstances you can mark the transaction as "read-only" by calling

[source,java]
-----
PersistenceManager pm = pmf.getPersistenceManager();
Transaction tx = pm.currentTransaction();
try
{
    tx.begin();
    tx.setRollbackOnly();

    {users code to persist objects}
    
    tx.rollback();
}
finally
{
    if (tx.isActive())
    {
        tx.rollback();
    }
}
pm.close();
-----

Any call to _commit_ on the transaction will throw an exception forcing the user to roll it back.



[[transaction_savepoint]]
== Transaction Savepoints

image:../images/nucleus_extension.png[]

NOTE: Applicable to RDBMS

JDBC provides the ability to specify a point in a transaction and rollback to that point if required, assuming the JDBC driver supports it.
DataNucleus provides this as a vendor extension, as follows

[source,javva]
-----
import org.datanucleus.api.jdo.JDOTransaction;

PersistenceManager pm = pmf.getPersistenceManager();
JDOTransaction tx = (JDOTransaction)pm.currentTransaction();
try
{
    tx.begin();

    {users code to persist objects}
    tx.setSavepoint("Point1");

    {more user code to persist objects}
    tx.rollbackToSavepoint("Point1");

    tx.releaseSavepoint("Point1");
    tx.rollback();
}
finally
{
    if (tx.isActive())
    {
        tx.rollback();
    }
}
pm.close();
-----


== Transaction Locking

A Transaction forms a unit of work. The Transaction manages what happens within that unit of work, 
and when an error occurs the Transaction can roll back any changes performed. 
There are the following locking types for a transaction.

* Transactions can lock all records in a datastore and keep them locked until they are ready to commit their changes. 
These are known as link:#locking_pessimistic[Pessimistic (or datastore) Locking].
* Transactions can simply assume that things in the datastore will not change until they are ready to commit, not lock any records and 
then just before committing make a check for changes. This is known as link:#locking_optimistic[Optimistic Locking].



[[locking_pessimistic]]
=== Pessimistic (Datastore) Locking

Pessimistic locking is suitable for short lived operations where no user interaction is taking place and so it is possible to block access to datastore entities 
for the duration of the transaction. By default DataNucleus does not currently lock the objects fetched with pessimistic locking, but you can configure this 
behaviour for RDBMS datastores by setting the persistence property *datanucleus.SerializeRead* to _true_. 
This will result in all "SELECT ... FROM ..." statements being changed to be "SELECT ... FROM ... FOR UPDATE". 
This will be applied only where the underlying RDBMS supports the "FOR UPDATE" syntax. This can be done on a transaction-by-transaction basis by doing

[source,java]
-----
Transaction tx = pm.currentTransaction();
tx.setSerializeRead(true);
-----

Alternatively, on a per query basis, you would do

[source,java]
-----
Query q = pm.newQuery(...);
q.setSerializeRead(true);
-----

With pessimistic locking DataNucleus will grab a datastore connection at the first operation, and maintain it for the duration of the transaction. 
A single connection is used for the transaction (with the exception of any link:mapping.html#value_generation[Value Generation] operations which need 
datastore access, so these can use their own connection).

In terms of the process of pessimistic (datastore) locking, we demonstrate this below.

[cols="1,3,3", options="header"]
|===
|Operation
|DataNucleus process
|Datastore process

|Start transaction
|
|

|Persist object
|Prepare object (1) for persistence
|*Open connection*
Insert the object (1) into the datastore

|Update object
|Prepare object (2) for update
|Update the object (2) into the datastore

|Persist object
|Prepare object (3) for persistence
|Insert the object (3) into the datastore

|Update object
|Prepare object (4) for update
|Update the object (4) into the datastore

|Flush
|No outstanding changes so do nothing
|

|Perform query
|Generate query in datastore language
|Query the datastore and return selected objects

|Persist object
|Prepare object (5) for persistence
|Insert the object (5) into the datastore

|Update object
|Prepare object (6) for update
|Update the object (6) into the datastore

|Commit transaction
|
|*Commit connection*
|===

So here whenever an operation is performed, DataNucleus pushes it straight to the datastore.
Consequently any queries will always reflect the current state of all objects in use.
However this mode of operation has no version checking of objects and so if they were updated by external processes in the meantime then they will overwrite those changes.

It should be noted that DataNucleus provides two persistence properties that allow an amount of control over when flushing happens with pessimistic locking

* _datanucleus.flush.mode_ when set to MANUAL will try to delay all datastore operations until commit/flush.
* _datanucleus.datastoreTransactionFlushLimit_ represents the number of dirty objects before a flush is performed. This defaults to 1.




[[locking_optimistic]]
=== Optimistic Locking

*Optimistic* locking is the other option in JDO. 
It is suitable for longer lived operations maybe where user interaction is taking place and where it would be undesirable to block access to 
datastore entities for the duration of the transaction. The assumption is that data altered in this transaction will not be updated by 
other transactions during the duration of this transaction, so the changes are not propagated to the datastore until commit()/flush(). 
The data is checked just before commit to ensure the integrity in this respect. 
The most convenient way of checking data for updates is to maintain a column on each table that handles optimistic locking data. 
The user will decide this when generating their MetaData.

Rather than placing version/timestamp columns on all user datastore tables, JDO allows the user to notate particular classes as requiring *optimistic* treatment. 
This is performed by specifying in MetaData or annotations the details of the field/column to use for storing the version - see link:mapping.html#versioning[versioning]. 
With JDO the version is added in a surrogate column, whereas a vendor extension allows you to have a field in your class ready to store the version.

When the version is stored in a surrogate column in the datastore, JDO provides a helper method for accessing this version.
You can call 
[source,java]
-----
JDOHelper.getVersion(object);
-----
and this returns the version as an Object (typically Long or Timestamp). 
It will return null for a transient object, and will return the version for a persistent object. If the object is not _persistable_ then it will also return null.

In terms of the process of optimistic locking, we demonstrate this below.

[cols="1,3,3a", options="header"]

* *Commit connection*
|===


Here no changes make it to the datastore until the user either commits the transaction, or they invoke flush(). 
The impact of this is that when performing a query, by default, the results may not contain the modified objects unless they are flushed 
to the datastore before invoking the query. 
Depending on whether you need the modified objects to be reflected in the results of the query governs what you do about that. 
If you invoke flush() just before running the query the query results will include the changes. The obvious benefit of optimistic locking is that
all changes are made in a block and version checking of objects is performed before application of changes, hence this mode copes better with external processes updating the objects.

Please note that for some datastores (e.g RDBMS) the version check followed by update/delete is performed in a single statement.
