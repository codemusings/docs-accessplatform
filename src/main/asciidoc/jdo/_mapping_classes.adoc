We have the following types of classes in DataNucleus JDO.

* link:#persistence_capable[PersistenceCapable] - persistable class with full control over its persistence.
* link:#persistence_aware[PersistenceAware] - a class that is not itself persisted, but that needs to access internals of persistable classes. 

NOTE: In strict JDO all persistable classes need to have a default constructor. 
With DataNucleus JDO this is not necessary, since all classes are enhanced before persistence and the enhancer adds on a default constructor if one is not defined. 


[[persistence_capable]]
== Persistence Capable Classes

The first thing to decide when implementing your persistence layer is which classes are to be persisted.
Let's take a sample class (_Hotel_) as an example. We can define a class as persistable using either annotations in the class, or XML metadata. Like this

[source,java]
-----
@PersistenceCapable
public class Hotel
{
    ...
}
-----

or using XML metadata

[source,xml]
-----
<class name="Hotel">
    ...
</class>
-----

* link:metadata_xml.html#class[MetaData reference for <class> element]
* link:annotations.html#PersistenceCapable[Annotations reference for @PersistenceCapable]

NOTE: If any of your other classes *access the fields of these persistable classes directly* then these other classes should be defined as _PersistenceAware_.



[[persistence_aware]]
== Persistence-Aware Classes

If a class is not itself persistable but it interacts with _fields_ of persistable classes then it should be marked as _Persistence Aware_.
You do this as follows

[source,java]
-----
@PersistenceAware
public class MyClass
{
    ...
}
-----

or using XML metadata

[source,xml]
-----
<class name="MyClass" persistence-modifier="persistence-aware">
    ...
</class>
-----

* link:annotations.html#PersistenceAware[Annotations reference for @PersistenceAware]


[[read_only]]
== Read-Only Classes

image:../images/nucleus_extension.png[]

You can, if you wish, make a class "read-only". This is a DataNucleus extension and you set it as follows

[source,java]
-----
@PersistenceCapable
@Extension(vendorName="datanucleus", key="read-only", value="true")
public class MyClass
{
    ...
}
-----

or using XML metadata

[source,xml]
-----
<class name="MyClass">
    ...
    <extension vendor-name="datanucleus" key="read-only" value="true"/>
</class>
-----
