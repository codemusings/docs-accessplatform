NOTE: Applicable to RDBMS

The standard JDO persistence strategy is to persist an object of a class into its own table. 
In some situations you may wish to map the class to a primary table as well as one or more secondary 
tables. For example when you have a Java class that could have been split up into 2 separate classes 
yet, for whatever reason, has been written as a single class, however you have a legacy datastore and 
you need to map objects of this class into 2 tables. JDO allows persistence of fields of a class 
into _secondary_ tables.

The process for managing this situation is best demonstrated with an example. Let's suppose we have 
a class that represents a *Printer*. The *Printer* class contains within it various 
attributes of the toner cartridge. So we have

[source,java]
-----
package com.mydomain.samples.secondarytable;

public class Printer
{
    long id;
    String make;
    String model;

    String tonerModel;
    int tonerLifetime;

    ...
}
-----

Now we have a database schema that has 2 tables (`PRINTER` and `PRINTER_TONER`) in which to store objects of this class. 
So we need to tell DataNucleus to perform this mapping. So we define the MetaData for the *Printer* class like this

[source,xml]
-----
<class name="Printer" table="PRINTER">
    <join table="PRINTER_TONER" column="PRINTER_REFID"/>

    <field name="id" primary-key="true" column="PRINTER_ID"/>
    <field name="make" column="MAKE"/>
    <field name="model" column="MODEL"/>
    <field name="tonerModel" table="PRINTER_TONER" column="MODEL"/>
    <field name="tonerLifetime" table="PRINTER_TONER" column="LIFETIME"/>
</class>
-----

So here we have defined that objects of the *Printer* class will be stored in the primary table `PRINTER`. 
In addition we have defined that some fields are stored in the table `PRINTER_TONER`. This is achieved by way of

* We will store _tonerModel_ and _tonerLifetime_ in the table `PRINTER_TONER`. This is achieved by using <field *table="PRINTER_TONER"*>
* The table `PRINTER_TONER` will use a primary key column called `PRINTER_REFID`. This is achieved by using <join table="PRINTER_TONER" column="PRINTER_REFID"/>

You could equally specify this using annotations

[source,java]
-----
@PersistenceCapable
@Join(table="PRINTER_TONER", column="PRINTER_REFID")
public class Printer
{
    @Persistent(primaryKey="true", column="PRINTER_ID")
    long id;
    @Column(name="MAKE")
    String make;
    @Column(name="MODEL")
    String model;

    @Persistent(table="PRINTER_TONER", column="MODEL")
    String tonerModel;
    @Persistent(table="PRINTER_TONER", column="LIFETIME")
    int tonerLifetime;
    ...
}
-----

This results in the following database tables :-
image:../images/secondarytables_db.png[]

So we now have our primary and secondary database tables. The primary key of the `PRINTER_TONER` table serves as a foreign key to the primary class. 
Whenever we persist a *Printer* object a row will be inserted into *both* of these tables.


== Specifying the primary key

You saw above how we defined the column name that will be the primary key of the secondary table (the `PRINTER_REFID` column). 
What we didn't show is how to specify the name of the primary key constraint to be generated. To do this you change the MetaData to

[source,xml]
-----
<class name="Printer" identity-type="datastore" table="PRINTER">
    <join table="PRINTER_TONER" column="PRINTER_REFID">
        <primary-key name="TONER_PK"/>
    </join>

    ...
</class>
-----

So this will create the primary key constraint with the name "TONER_PK".
