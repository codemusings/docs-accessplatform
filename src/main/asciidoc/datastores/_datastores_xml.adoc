DataNucleus supports persisting/retrieving objects to/from XML documents 
(using the https://github.com/datanucleus/datanucleus-xml[datanucleus-xml] plugin).
Simply specify your "connectionURL" as follows

-----
datanucleus.ConnectionURL=xml:file:myfile.xml
-----

replacing `myfile.xml` with your filename, which can be absolute or relative.

It makes use of JAXB, and the jars required to use DataNucleus XML persistence are `datanucleus-core`,
`datanucleus-api-jdo`/`datanucleus-api-jpa`, `datanucleus-xml` and `JAXB API`, `JAXB Reference Implementation`.
If you wish to help out in this effort either by contributing or by sponsoring particular functionality please contact us.

Things to bear in mind with XML usage :-

* Indentation of XML : the persistence property *datanucleus.xml.indentSize* defaults to 4 but you can set it to the desired indent size
* Application identity is supported but can only have 1 PK field and must be a String. This is a limitation of the JAXB reference implementation
* Persistent properties are not supported, only persistent fields
* Out of the box it will use the JAXB reference implementation. You could, in principle, provide support for other JAXB implementations by implementing
_org.datanucleus.store.xml.JAXBHandler_ and then specify the persistence property *datanucleus.xml.jaxbHandlerClass* to the JAXBHandler
implementation. If you do manage to write a JAXBHandler for other JAXB implementations please consider contributing it to the project


== Mapping : XML Datastore Mapping

When persisting a Java object to an XML datastore clearly the user would like some control over the structure of the XML document.
Here's an example using JDO XML MetaData

[source,xml]
-----
<jdo>
    <package name="mydomain.model.company">
        <class name="Person" detachable="true" schema="/myproduct/people" table="person">
            <field name="personNum">
                <extension vendor-name="datanucleus" key="XmlAttribute" value="true"/>
            </field>
            <field name="firstName" primary-key="true"/> <!-- PK since JAXB requires String -->
            <field name="lastName"/>
            <field name="bestFriend"/>
        </class>
    </package>
</jdo>
-----

Things to note :

* *schema* on class is used to define the "XPath" to the root of the class in XML. You can also use the extension "xpath" to specify the same thing.
* *table* on class is used to define the name of the element for an object of the particular class.
* *column* on field is used to define the name of the element for a field of the particular class.
* *XmlAttribute* : when set to true denotes that this will appear in the XML file as an attribute of the overall element for the object
* When a field is primary-key it will gain a JAXB "XmlID" attribute.
* When a field is a relation to another object (and the field is not embedded) then it will gain a JAXB "XmlIDREF" attribute as a link to the other object.
* *Important : JAXB has a limitation for primary keys* : there can only be a single PK field, and it must be a String!

What is generated with the above is as follows

[source,xml]
-----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<myproduct>
    <people>
        <person personNum="1">
            <firstName>Bugs</firstName>
            <lastName>Bunny</lastName>
            <bestFriend>My</bestFriend>
        </person>        
    </people>
</myproduct>
-----

Here's the same example using JDO Annotations

[source,java]
-----
@PersistenceCapable(schema="/myproduct/people", table="person")
public class Person
{
    @XmlAttribute
    private long personNum;

    @PrimaryKey
    private String firstName;

    private String lastName;

    private Person bestFiend;

    @XmlElementWrapper(name="phone-numbers")
    @XmlElement(name="phone-number")
    @Element(types=String.class)
    private Map phoneNumbers = new HashMap();
   
    ...

Here's the same example using JPA Annotations (with DataNucleus @Extension annotation)
