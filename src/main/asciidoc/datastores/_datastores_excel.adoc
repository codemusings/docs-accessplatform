DataNucleus supports persistence to Excel _spreadsheets_ using the https://github.com/datanucleus/datanucleus-excel[datanucleus-excel] plugin, 
which makes use of the Apache POI project. Simply specify your "connectionURL" as follows

-----
datanucleus.ConnectionURL=excel:file:myfile.xls
-----

replacing `myfile.xls` with your filename, which can be absolute or relative. This connects to a file on your local machine. 
You need to have the _org.apache.poi_ `poi.jar` in the CLASSPATH.

Things to bear in mind with Excel usage :-

* Relations : A spreadsheet cannot store related objects directly, since each object is a row of a particular worksheet. 
DataNucleus gets around this by storing the String-form of the identity of the related object in the relation cell.
