DataNucleus supports persisting/retrieving objects to/from Excel documents (using the https://github.com/datanucleus/datanucleus-excel[datanucleus-excel] plugin, 
which makes use of the Apache POI project). Simply specify your "connectionURL" as follows

-----
datanucleus.ConnectionURL=excel:file:myfile.xls
-----

replacing `myfile.xls` with your filename, which can be absolute or relative. This connects to a file on your local machine. 
You then create your PMF/EMF as normal and use JDO/JPA as normal.

The jars required to use DataNucleus Excel persistence are `datanucleus-core`, `datanucleus-api-jdo`/`datanucleus-api-jpa`, `datanucleus-excel` and `apache-poi`.

There are tutorials available for use of DataNucleus with Excel link:../jdo/tutorial_excel.html[for JDO] and link:../jpa/tutorial_excel.html[for JPA]

Things to bear in mind with Excel usage :-

* Querying can be performed using JDOQL or JPQL. Any filtering/ordering will be performed *in-memory*
* Relations : A spreadsheet cannot store related objects directly, since each object is a row of a particular worksheet. 
DataNucleus gets around this by storing the String-form of the identity of the related object in the relation cell.
