        <section name="AccessPlatform : Compatibility">
            <p>
                We aim to make DataNucleus AccessPlatform as compatible with related software as possible.
                Here we give an overview of known compatibilities/problems
            </p>

                        <i>Version 1 of Play had a hardcoded Hibernate implementation which was obviously a bad idea 
                        when the whole point of having a persistence standard (JPA) is to allow portability.</i></td>

                        JDO/JPA objects. Earlier GWT versions had a problem with a bytecode enhancement field of
                        type Object[] and there was a project
                        <a href="http://noon.gilead.free.fr/gilead/" target="_blank">GILEAD</a> that
                        attempted to handle this for various persistence solutions (and in version 1.3 will
                        have specific support for DataNucleus, already in Gilead SVN).
